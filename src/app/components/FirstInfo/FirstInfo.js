				<p>
					With a notion that fitness activities are not just mere 3
					times a week routine, but rather a day-to-day lifestyle, we
					have opened a first of our fitness centers in the cityâ€¦ When
					we were asking ourselves, whether we would be able to offer
					something different to what other fitness studios do offer,
					we found the answer. It was - a skilled team of trainers!
